History of Dogs

Origins of the Canine-Human Bond
The history of dogs is deeply intertwined with the evolution of human civilization. Archaeological evidence suggests that dogs were among the first animals to be domesticated by humans, with the relationship dating back tens of thousands of years. Initially, this collaboration might have been rooted in mutual benefitâ€”humans provided food and shelter, while dogs assisted with tasks like hunting, guarding, and herding. Over time, this functional partnership evolved into a profound emotional bond. The companionship, loyalty, and assistance provided by dogs played a pivotal role in the development of societies across the globe, from ancient civilizations to the present day.
